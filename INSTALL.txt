Building & installing pyBoxshade

These instructions are only for those wanting to build from source. For most users,
it is best to download the pre-built binary for your system.


Required:
The pyBoxshade source files and the images folder (various icons used by the program)
python 3.x (developed against 3.8)
In your python installation, you need:
PyQt5 (I used 5.14.1)
numpy (I used 1.18.1)
biopython (I used 1.76)
These can be installed using pip (on MacOS X, your Python v 3 installation may require you to
use "pip3" instead of "pip")

pip install numpy, biopython, pyqt5

To package the application, I used pyinstaller

pip install pyinstaller

If it is not already installed, "pip install pyinstaller" will also install setuptools, required by pyinstaller. 
At the time of writing, there is a problem with pyinstaller and setuptools, and you need to 
use a version of setuptools < 45.

A) Running from the command line:
To run the application from python, ensure you are in the folder with the source code or
have that folder in your PYTHONPATH, then:

python BS_app.py
(you may have to type python3 BS_app.py on a Mac depending on how python v 3.x was installed)

B) Packaging as an application:
In the folder containing the source and the images folder, type one of the following:
on Mac OSX:
pyi-makespec -n pyBoxshade -w BS_app.py

on Windows:
pyi-makespec -n pyBoxshade -w --onefile BS_app.py

This creates a file pyBoxshade.spec. Edit this file as follows:
replace the line
datas=[],

with
datas=[('images', 'images')],

and replace the line
excludes=[],

with
excludes=['FixTk', 'tcl', 'tk', '_tkinter', 'tkinter', 'Tkinter'],

Save this file and then type
pyinstaller pyBoxshade.spec

On Mac OSX this will create a stand-alone Mac application folder called pyBoxshade.app,
which will launch as a normal application. 
On Windows this creates a stand-alone pyBoxshade.exe, which behaves as a normal Windows 
application except that it is a little slow to startup (it has to unpack the python 
environment to a temporary folder and run from there).
